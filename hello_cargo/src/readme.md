## SUMARY

- We can create a project using **cargo new**.
- We can build a project using **cargo build**.
- We can build and run a project without producing a binary to check for errors using **cargo check**.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
- An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system youâ€™re working on.
